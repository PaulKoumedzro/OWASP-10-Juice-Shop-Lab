# OWASP-10-Juice-Shop-Lab

# Objective

The objective of the OWASP Juice Shop lab is to provide hands-on experience in identifying and exploiting common web application vulnerabilities in a controlled environment. The key concept is to learn about ecurity concepts, including the OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities, while practicing ethical hacking techniques such as input validation testing, authentication bypass, SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and more. The lab aims to enhance participants penetration testing skills, foster a deeper understanding of application security risks, and promote secure coding practices.


# Skill Learned
- Learning to identify insecure coding patterns that lead to vulnerabilities.
- Assessing weak authentication mechanisms and testing session management flaws.
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
